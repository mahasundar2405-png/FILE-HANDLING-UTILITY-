The File Handling Utility project is developed using Java and its built-in file handling tools. The main tool used is the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is required to compile and execute the Java program. The program is written using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Notepad++, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code. For file operations, the project uses classes from the java.io package. The FileWriter class is used to create and write data into a text file, the FileReader class is used to read data from the file, and the BufferedReader class is used to read the file content line by line efficiently.
